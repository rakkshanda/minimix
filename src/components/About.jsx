              My name is Rakshanda. I grew up in India and now live in Seattle. Having moved around the world since a young age, my work is heavily influenced by the mundane moments of life and diverse cultural experiences. As a passionate software developer and product designer, I love creating meaningful digital experiences that blend functionality with beautiful design.

              Outside work, I like to explore new coffee shops around the city, experiment with different brewing methods, travel to new places, and spend time with friends and family.
